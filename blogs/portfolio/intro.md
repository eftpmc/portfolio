The idea for this web app is to track development of the several different projects I am working on. This is in preperation for a digital class I am taking at my highschool. Hopefully, it will organize development and show what my intent is with changes made. Currently you can create markdown files that will be displayed in the project, commits from the projects repository are also displayed chronologically to show a timeline.

I have some cleaning up to do and some more features to add. I will make a new post when the time comes.
