React Hooks not only simplify state management in functional components but also offer a more intuitive way to handle side effects. This is where `useEffect` comes into play. Introduced alongside other Hooks in React 16.8, `useEffect` has replaced lifecycle methods in functional components, providing a more straightforward approach to dealing with side effects.

### Understanding useEffect

The `useEffect` Hook is used to perform side effects in function components. Side effects can be anything from data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React components. In class components, these operations would typically be performed in lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useEffect` is used to update the document's title every time the `count` state changes. This illustrates how `useEffect` can replicate the behavior of the `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods in class components.

### Conditional Execution in useEffect

One of the powerful features of `useEffect` is its ability to conditionally execute effects based on specific state or props changes. By passing an array of dependencies to `useEffect`, you can control when the effect runs.
