This was a platform created with the intent to access every form of entertainment online. I reverse engineered websites that stream videos and files and sanitized those files. I then presented the files in an accessible form to users. The project is currently abandonded as of now because of the amount of work it required. Maintaining a few sources at the same time sometimes proved difficult. I may return in the future but for now the project no longer works.
